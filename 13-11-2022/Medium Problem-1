Question:

A coumputer manufacuturing company produces a large number of computers every day. It would like to assign a unique code to each computer for the purpose of 
internal tracking.

In order to generate unique codes for every computer, it was thought to combine the last two generated codes in reverse order.

For example, if the first two computers  have unique codes a and b, the third computers unique code will be ba (generated by combining b and a) and fourth computer's
unique code will be bab (generated by combining ba and b).

Your task is to help the company by determining the Nth computer's unique code  using first two computers unique codes.

Write a program that reads a that reads the first two computer's unique codes of the company and a number N and prints the Nth computer's unique code.

Input: The first line of input contains space-seperated strings reresenting the first two computer's unique codes A and B.
       The second line of input contains an integer representing the number N.
       
Output: The output should be a single line containing a string  representing the Nth computer's unique code.

Explanation:

Test Case 1: If the given A=i, B=b and N=3

* The first two computer's unique codes i and b the third computer unique code will be bi (generated by combining b and i).
* So the output should be bi.

Test Case 2: If the given A=g, B=o and N=7

* The first two computer's unique codes i and b the third computer unique code will be og (generated by combining o and g) and the fourth computer's uinue code 
will be ogo (generated by combining og and o) and etc.

* So the output should be ogoogogoogoog.


Sample Input 1:
i b
3
Sample Output 1:
bi

Sample Input 2:
g o
7
Sample Output 2:
ogoogogoogoog

Solution:

a,b=input().split()
n=int(input())
c=""
for i in range(3,n+1):
    c=b+a 
    a=b 
    b=c
print(c)
