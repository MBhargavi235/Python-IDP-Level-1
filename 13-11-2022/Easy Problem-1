Question:
Write a program that reads a password P and prints the strength of the given password.
calculate the strength of the password as below

* Add 1 point for each uppercase and lowercase letter in the password
* Add 2 points for each number and special character in the password, Consider only !@#$%^&()-+ as the special characters.
* Add 10 points, if the password contains at least one lower case letter, one uppercase letter, one number and one  special character.

Input: The input will be a sinle line containing string reresenting the password P
Output: The input will be a sinle line containing an integer reresenting the Strength of the password.

Explanation:

Test Case 1: If the given password P=Welcome3@

P Consists of 1 Uppercase letter (W)-->1*1=1
P Consists of 6 Lowercase letters (elcome)-->6*1=6
P Consists of 1 number (W)-->1*2=2
P Consists of 1 special character (@)-->1*2=2
P Consists of at least one lower case letter, one uppercase letter, one number and one  special character --> 10

The sum of all points is 1+6+2+2+10 = 21

Test Case 1: If the given password P=Qwerty$@

P Consists of 1 Uppercase letter (Q)-->1*1=1
P Consists of 5 Lowercase letters (werty)-->5*1=5
P Consists of 0 numbers -->0*2=0
P Consists of 2 special characters ($@)-->2*2=4

The sum of all points is 1+5+0+4 = 10

Sample Input 1:
Welcome3@

Sample Ouput 1:
21

Sample Input 1:
Qwerty$@

Sample Ouput 1:
10


Solution 1:

a=input()
countdigit=0
countlower=0 
countupper=0 
countSpecial=0 
countAll=0
for i in a:
    if i.isdigit():
        countdigit+=2
    if i.isupper():
        countupper+=1
    if i.islower():
        countlower+=1 
    if i=="!" or i=="@" or i=="#" or i=="$" or i=="%" or i=="^" or i=="&" or i=="*" or i=="(" or i==")" or i=="-" or i=="+":
        countSpecial+=2
if countdigit>0 and countlower>0 and countupper>0 and countSpecial>0:
    countAll=10
print(countdigit+countlower+countupper+countSpecial+countAll)
