Rohit Travelled to America.On his return to India, he planned to bring some gadgets.

He has that weigh from 1 to M. But when Rohit travels on an aeroplane, he is only allowed to carry a maximum weight of W.
So, he wants to leave some of the gadgets which are already available in India and bring the maximum number of gadgets that are not available in India.

Write a program that reads M gadgets, W weight limit and N space-seperated weights of common gadgets available in India and prints the maximum number of unique 
gadgets that can be brought into India.

Input: The first line of input contains space-seperated integers representing the no.of gadgets M, the maximum weight limit W, and number of gadgets weights N.
       The second line of input contains N space-seperated integers representing the weights of common gadgets available in India.
       
Output: The ouput should be a single line containg an integer representing the maximum number of unique gadgets that can be brought into India.

Explanation:

Test Case 1: If the given M=10, W=10, N=3 and gadgets_weights= 1 3 5 

The no.of gadgets Rohit wants to bring to India 10, which weights between 1 and 10, so the gadget weights are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
The maximum weight he can carry on an aeroplane is 10.
The gadgets weights that are available in India is 1 3 5. After removing th common gadget weights are 2 4 6 7 8 9 10
The possible combinations of weight sets are less than 10 are 2 4, 2 6, 2 8, 4 6
The maximum of no.of unique gadgets that can be brought into India is 2.

So the output should be 2.

Test Case 2: If the given M=14, W=13, N=4 and gadgets_weights= 4 6 8 9

The no.of gadgets Rohit wants to bring to India 14, which weights between 1 and 14, so the gadget weights are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14.
The maximum weight he can carry on an aeroplane is 13.
The gadgets weights that are available in India is 4 6 8 9. After removing th common gadget weights are 3 5 7 10 11 12 13 14
The possible combinations of weight sets are less than 13 are 1 2 3 5,  1 2 2 7 
The maximum of no.of unique gadgets that can be brought into India is 4.

So the output should be 4.


Sample Input 1:
10 10 3
1 3 5

Sample Output 1:
2

Sample Input 2:
14 13 4
4 6 8 9

Sample Output 1:
4


Solution:

m,w,n=list(map(int,input().split()))
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
lista=[]
for i in range(1,m+1):
    if i not in a:
        lista.append(i)
def cmbns(lista):
    if len(lista)==0:
        return [[]]
    a=[]
    for i in cmbns(lista[1:]):
        a+=[i,i+[lista[0]]]
    return a 
res=cmbns(lista)
b=[]
for i in res[1:]:
    if sum(i)<w:
        b.append(len(i))
print(max(b))
